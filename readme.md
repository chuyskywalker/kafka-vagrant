# Kafka Demo

This will boot up a CentOS6 instance, install a single instance of ZooKeeper and
a 3 "node" Kafka cluster. The "nodes" here simply refer to having 3 running
instances to simulate a cluster. All of this is controlled by supervisor,
just because I like it so much.

`vagrant up` and you're good to have some toy time with Kafka.
